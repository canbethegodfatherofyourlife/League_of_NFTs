                    Cricket in India is an emotion. And, IPL rules over the hearts of millions of cricket fans over the world. But, for the huge amount of time they invest in it, what do they get except entertainment?.

                    Users can trade player nfts and book regular profits by anticipating which nft could have an upside in the immediate future. 
                    Finally, at the end of the tournament we are going to reward users with highest scores, so they must try to maximise their scores by buying NFTs of players in good form.
